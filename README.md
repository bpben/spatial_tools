# Tools for spatial analysis with Python
A somewhat disorgnized repository of some useful tools I'm using to do spatial analysis in Python.

Currently included
- Script for extracting intersections in road network maps
- Script (based on TSPLIB) for solving Traveling Salesman Problems using Open Street Maps network

To include
